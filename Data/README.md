## UCF101 - Action Recognition Data Set

The video classification project in this repository utilizes the UCF101 dataset, an action recognition dataset of realistic action videos collected from YouTube. The dataset consists of 101 action categories, offering diversity in actions and challenging variations in camera motion, object appearance, pose, scale, viewpoint, background clutter, and illumination conditions.

### Dataset Details

- **Dataset Origin**: UCF101 is an extension of the UCF50 dataset and was introduced as the main competition benchmark in the First International Workshop on Action Recognition with Large Number of Classes during ICCV'13.
- **Dataset Contents**: It comprises 13,320 videos across 101 action categories, grouped into 25 sets with 4-7 videos per action, emphasizing realism and diversity.
- **Action Categories**: The categories include Human-Object Interaction, Body-Motion Only, Human-Human Interaction, Playing Musical Instruments, and Sports.
